-----------------


**IMAge/enGINE** is an open source software for rapid computation of high-dimensional medical image data. It employs a concise UI for clinical researchers without engineering/programming background. In this repository,developers may use the ADC and eADC calculation as an example to implement their own algorithm. Comparing to other open-source software, such as 3DSlicer and ImageJ, IMAge/enGINE is more focused on computation speed and easy-to-use GUI. IMAge/enGINE was originally developed by the R&D team of Vusion Tech Ltd. Co.  

[www.vusion.com.cn] hosts a binary version of IMAge/enGINE equiped with multiple diffusion MRI models which is free to download and use for research and/or education purpose except for the clinical trials funded by pharmaceutical companies and scanner manufactures. 



## Build requirement
ITK 4.11.1, built with itkvtk glue option on
VTK 7.1, built with vtkdicom remote module on
CTK, only DICOMcore DICOMwidget and CTKwidgets are needed
QT 5.8

## Implement your own algorithm
Please check out the ADC calculation in DiffusionCore module and use it as an example.

## Contribution/Collaboration
If you would like to contribute or help with the implementation with your own algorithm for research or business, please contact with us for details by sending emails to [customer@vusion.com.cn].
